As an adult, the most interesting man in the world was ready for anything.  So that is why he decided to set the world record for running around the equator the fastest.  He started off by going to his mansion in Brazil.  He didn’t even have to call a helicopter, because his robot just automatically knows when and where he wants to go at all times.  After he got there, a man offered him bug repellent, but little did the man know, he didn’t need it.  Mosquitoes refuse to bite him purely out of respect.  He didn’t need to stretch, so he just started running.  He completed the world record with the help of the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot and in exchange, THEY got to take pictures of HIM.
