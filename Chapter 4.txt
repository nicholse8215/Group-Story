In old-age he started drinking a lot of Dos Equis. He denied his growing addiction, claiming "I don't always drink." But every time anyone saw him, he has a Dos Equis in his hand. He was delusional and began making outrageous claims on live television. Things like, "my blood smells like cologne" and "I can speak Russian... in French." As his outrageousness increased, so did his intake of Dos Equis. He died a raging alcoholic, believing that he was flying away to the moon. He left his son his legacy and fame.
