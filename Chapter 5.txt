The most interesting man in the world has done some very interesting things, I’m here to talk about the MOST interesting things the most interesting man in the world has done. First and foremost he took a shuttle to the moon and yes he hasn’t come back, but whether he died or still lives there... THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW!!! He has also won the lifetime achievement award...twice. Once a rattlesnake bit him, after 5 days of excruciating pain, the snake finally died. His tears can cure cancer...too bad he never cries. His friends call him by his name, his enemies don’t call him anything, they’re all dead. He once won a staring contest...with his own reflection. HELL...EVEN THE DARK IS AFRAID OF HIM!!!!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR!!!
