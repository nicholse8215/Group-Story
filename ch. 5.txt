The most interesting man in the world has done some very interesting things, im here to talk about the
 MOST interesting things the most interesting man in the world has done. First and foremost he took a shuttel
 to the moon and yes he hasnt come back,but whether he died or still lives there... THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW!!! 
 He has also won the lifetime achievment award...twice. Once a rattlesnake bit him, after 5 days of excruciating 
 pain, the snake finally died. His tears can cure cancer...too bad he never cries. His friends call him by his 
 name, his enemies dont call him anything, theyre all dead. He once won a staring contest...with his own 
 reflection. HELL...EVEN THE DARK IS AFRAID OF HIM!!!!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR!!!
